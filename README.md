# AZ Waters: An Interactive Storymap

This project is an interactive, scroll-driven storymap exploring the major water systems of Central Arizona: the Central Arizona Project (CAP) and the Salt River Project (SRP). It visualizes the journey of water from its source to cities and farms, and delves into the modern challenges of drought, policy, and water markets.
