The pilot project was intended to assess the long-term feasibility of operating a larger full-scale recharge project. During the pilot phase, 20,000 acre-feet of CAP water were recharged. Full-scale operations began on September 8, 2000 using the pilot basin while construction of the expansion project was underway. The project expansion was constructed between May and December 2001. The completed facility provides a maximum permitted annual recharge capacity of 30,000 acre-feet. Full-scale operation of the expansion basins began December, 2001.Â  \u003c/div\u003e \u003c/font\u003e"}}]}
