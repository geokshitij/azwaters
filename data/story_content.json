This story explores the journey of water through the Central Arizona Project and the Salt River Project, which are the systems that make life in the Sun Corridor possible. These are feats of engineering that allowed an oasis to bloom in the desert. Today, they are at the center of a modern struggle against historic drought, growing demand, and the complex laws governing a finite resource. In the chapters that follow, we will:</p><ul><li>Explore the Colorado River's lifeline, starting at the iconic <strong>Hoover Dam</strong> and following the path of the <strong>Central Arizona Project (CAP)</strong>.</li><li>Journey through the reservoirs of the <strong>Salt River Project (SRP)</strong>, the resilient local system that powers Phoenix.</li><li>Uncover the modern reality of water in the West: the politics, the high-stakes water market, and the crucial roles played by <strong>farmers, cities, and Tribal Nations</strong>.</li></ul><p><em>For suggestions or feedback, please contact kdahal3@asu.edu.</em></p>",
